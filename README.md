#MecaCell
MecaCell is an open-source platform for the agent-based simulation of cells, with a strong focus on modularity and performance. It is designed with artificial life and morphogenetic engineering in mind and also tries to stay not too invasive and lightweight.
This repository consist only of mecacell, the core library which contains everything you need to run simulations in console or with your own viewer. It is written in C++14 and has no dependencies other than the C++ standard library.
Visualization tools have been and are being built to be paired with mecacell. So far, only one (mecacell-QtViewer, based on Qt5) is available but the list should eventually grow, and contributions are more than welcome.

#Architecture and main classes

##Install
You will need cmake 3.0+, a relatively recent C++ compiler (C++14 support is required)
- Clone this repository
- cd in it and create a build directory
- cmake .. && make && make install

To install the viewer, you need to have Qt5 installed.
You can use the latest Qt installer on the Qt website. Don't forget to tell cmake the location of your Qt5 installation. To do so, on Unix based systems, you can add to your .profile or .bashrc (or any script that can modify your environment variables) the following line:
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:/your/path/to/Qt5

##Basic usage & ultra simple example
You need at least one **cell type**.
   
Your cell type must inherit from the MecaCell::ConnectableCell (it uses the curriously reccuring template for performances reason, so the inherit line is a little bit more verbose):
```c++
class MyCell : public MecaCell::ConnectableCell<MyCell> {
```
a cell is required to have at least 2 methods:
```c++
	// returns the adhesion coef (between 0 & 1) with the cell *c
	double getAdhesionWith(const MyCell *c) { return 0.9; }
```
```c++
	// update routine, called at every loop iteration
	// returns a pointer to a new cell if division
	// returns nullptr if not
	MyCell* updateBehavior(double deltaTime) {
		// access inputs here
		return nullptr;
	}
};
```
  
Let's now create a scenario:

```c++
class MyScenario {
```
A scenario needs to contain a MecaCell::BasicWorld\<cell_type,integration_mode\> and let the viewer acces to it:
```c++
	using World = MecaCell::BasicWorld<MyCell, MecaCell::Euler>;
private:
	World w;

public:
	World &getWorld() { return w; }
```

It should also contain at least these 2 methods:
```c++
	// called at initialisation
	void init(int argc, char** argv) {
		// here we just add a cell at (0,0,0);
		w.addCell(new Cell(MecaCell::Vec::zero()));
	}
```
```c++
	void loop(){
		// this code is called before every frame by the viewer
		// here we just call the world update method, which will handle all the physics
    // and call our MyCell::updateBehavior() method
		w.update();
		// handle events, plug your own methods call, whatever you want goes in this method...
	}
};
```
Now for the main.cpp:
```c++
#include <mecacell/mecacell.h>
#include <mecacell/viewer/viewer.h>
#include "myscenario.h"
#include "mycell.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	MecacellViewer::Viewer<MyScenario> v;
	return v.exec(argc, argv);
}

```
That's it for our extremely basic example. Now you can compile your project (don't forget to link to mecacell library and mecacellviewer + Qt) and run it. You can run it without the viewer by just repeatedly calling yout scenario::loop() method (don't forget to init() first) instead of creating a viewer instance.
